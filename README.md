# Project-with-MEAN-Stack

With MEAN, we can  build an application that is completely written using JavaScript technologies from frontend to backend and also at the database level.
Delve deeper into MEAN Stack by building a real-world project. 
I have cover the complete code of end-to-end web application development with MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node .js 
The goal of this code is to help you master MEAN stack development, and will get a broader understanding of MEAN applications and build amazing application.

- MEAN Stack is an acronym for MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js 
â€“ whereby all these four are integrated to form solution-built full-stack JavaScript applications

Why MEAN Stack App Development such a great choice?.

- Using the same programming language in both the front and back ends of the application has multiple benefits.
  For one thing, it makes data communication between server and client simpler and faster.
  It makes modifications to either end easier. It also promotes reusing code across the multiple technologies that in turn helps keep the application secure and stable.
